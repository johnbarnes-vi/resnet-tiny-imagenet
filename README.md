# ViT-Implementations

This repository contains various implementations of Vision Transformer (ViT), a transformer model for computer vision tasks, on different datasets and using different methodologies.

## Structure

The repository is organized into several subdirectories, each of which contains a different implementation of ViT. These subdirectories include:

- `ViT-tinyimagenet200/`
- `ViT-Pulfer/`

### ViT-tinyimagenet200

The `ViT-tinyimagenet200/` directory contains an implementation of ViT on the Tiny ImageNet dataset (with 200 classes). 

Please note that the Tiny ImageNet dataset is **not** included in this repository due to its large size. 

#### Dataset Setup

If you want to run the code in the `ViT-tinyimagenet200/` directory, you will need to manually download the Tiny ImageNet dataset and place it in this directory. Here are the steps:

1. Download the `tiny-imagenet-200.zip` file from the [Tiny ImageNet website](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip).

2. Move the `tiny-imagenet-200.zip` file into the `ViT-tinyimagenet200/` directory.

3. Unzip the file in the `ViT-tinyimagenet200/` directory. This will create a `tiny-imagenet-200/` subdirectory with the dataset.

Once you've done this, the code in the `ViT-tinyimagenet200/` directory will be able to access the dataset and you will be able to run the notebooks in this directory.

For more details on the structure and content of the `tiny-imagenet-200/` directory, refer to our [detailed guide](Link_to_detailed_guide).
